This uses mixins to add Discord Webhook support to Pixelmon's battle log system.
<br>
<br>
Enter your discord webhook URL into the battle log scraper config (found at config/BattleLogScraper/config.yml), then whenever a battle crashes due to an error it will upload the battle crash report to the specified Discord channel.
<br>
<br>
It's appreciated if all battle logs could be forwarded to Pixelmon via their bug tracker with as much detail as possible. This will allow for faster, and easier, bug fixing when it comes to battles.
